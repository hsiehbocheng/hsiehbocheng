Hi, I'm Benson, a rookie data scientist in my first year, primarily responsible for the application of NLP and LLM in the property insurance industry. 

Below are my frameworks on both my personal blog and Medium, where I organize my notes from daily work. Feel free to take a look, as I hope they can be helpful to you. 

Additionally, you can find my LinkedIn and email below. Feel free to reach out to me.
